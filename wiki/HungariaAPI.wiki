= Introduction =

In creating the API, the aim was to work from the bottom up; creating accessor, helper, and utility functions that roughly correspond to practical tasks.

For example: 

 * get this person's primary name
 * get this person's birth event
 * get the date associated with this event
 * get the place associated with this event
 * generate a standard HTML link for this place
 * et cetera

While this approach means considerable amount of up-front work--arguably mostly wrapping existing GRAMPS functionality in slightly more intuitive ways--it makes coding higher level functionality considerably easier.
